            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>I believe that if the user is already on my site searching for a specific client, it's because they don't agree with the seller's price or they don't value the client as much as the seller, and we give a way for the user to test whatever client they want in order to find the perfect one for him. I consider this argument similar to Piracy, as Gane Newell, steam's owner, said "The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates" and Linus Torvalds, Linux's kernel creator, said "Software is like sex, it's better when it's free", I agree with both of them and studies show that pirates that are satisfied with the service, given by other pirates, will end up buying the original at full price. I think the same is true for paid hack clients, if someone made an actually good client, with every feature a user would need, then there would be way less users using cracks, so if you find a client that fits your needs and is paid or has a way to donate to it, please go buy/donate to them.</p>

            <h2>Are you a developer affected by our site?</h2>
            <p>Contact ReGiulio to value the potential temporary removal of your client from our website. If the effect is actually heavy on your sales, you're a single developer, barely making money, then contact me to discuss the eventual removal.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>MCHCC was founded by my friend "NotEvenClose" on late 2020, we'll call him Not, with the objective to archive, document and render available minecraft hack clients of every type to everyone. For that he called me, i was very into minecraft hack clients back then and was developing a client of my own. My job was to either find a safe crack of a client (and check it to verify) or make one (which happened a few times). I believe to have done a pretty good job, because Not made me owner. In early 2021 I come up with the idea to make a minecraft account generator, nothing crazy, and it mostly worked. 2021 was probably the most active time of MCHCC, i was constantly updating clients, added cracked anticheat, developed my own anticheat (that didn't work lol), added configs, quality of life improvements, added premium features and more and at a point we had a kit pvp server. All going great until early 2022 when I lost motivation to continue, i was not making any money, i wasn't getting anything in return, Not stopped responding to me, I was threatened by a client developer and i was busy with my personal life, so i slowly left. Comes late 2022 and a landslide hits my city, that signified the end of old MCHCC, i didn't even have a computer to sustain it anymore, so i said my goodbyes to the server hoping to come back one day. Early 2023 me and my family moved and in mid 2023 i finally had a pc available, much better than the old one, and in late 2023 i was thinking about coming back into MCHCC.</p>
            <h2>Present</h2>
            <p>MCHCC is in a state of rebuilding, i have to update all client and anticheats, then i have to upload them to the site and build the site around them. A lengthy process indeed since i have some like 68 clients to reupload and update and 15 anticheat. I hope to finish by the end of the month and make the site publicly available at the start of next month. It's only me, Not died a few month ago due to reasons i can't disclose out of respect, so any help would be appreciated.</p>
            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>MCHCC was born with the idea to archive minecraft hack clients, i hope to make this project last as long as possible. I'll first update the client i already have a crack for, then upload all of them (both old versions and new ones) to the discord and then to the website, then I'll start with the newer clients and anticheats. I hope to somewhat partner with hovac to create an even better experience, since I really like his site and some documents that help me keep track of what clients to post are from old hovac's posts. I don't want to force someone to give me money, so I'll link in the site a page to donate if the user feels he should, and I'll also not be using linkvertise or other shit like that, since it is pretty annoying for the user and i want to create the best user experience possible. I won't lie, i am thinking about making a launcher with all the clients, but for now i have no idea how to do it and no time to make it. I also will provide everything i can to prove that my clients aren't ratted or have any viruses in them, with the inclusion of a section dedicated to decompiler tools to go and check yourself (DISCLAIMER: I am still a human, mistakes can happen, if somehow a ratted client gets through and you notice it, please contact me immediately and I'll remove it). There will also be a section dedicated to clients' source codes that already works and just needs a bit of polishing. I'll update the discord soon, there you will find the MCHCC community, in wich you can interract and receive news in real time. I hope to create a Forum in the near future.</p>

                <p>A long time ago i was staff on a server, RedCommunity, and was tasked with the creation of an anticheat, this anticheat doesn't work currently and it has been discontinued for years after i got depexxed (because i played some videos in a public voicechat with some users and the owner, he was italian he understood everything said)</p>

                <h2>DeltaAirCrew</h2>
                <p>After i quit MCHCC back in 2022 i went on to play on an anarchy server called 6b6t, i met Unblow/Honey which was the owner of a kit distributing group (Delta Airlines), i joined her and we had a lot of fun duping the shit out of a lot of items and giving them to new users, I have a lot of memories of this period but it will be a story for another day, from beef with other kit distributors to actually retarded players. DeltaAirCrew was a program (not completed) based on mineflayer to try and automate our demands for new kits. The project died when Unblow/honey left the community out of nowhere, after that i was not able to keep the service up and left the community too, as it wasn't fun to play anarchy anymore.</p>
