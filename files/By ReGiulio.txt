Hi, ReGiulio speaking, if you are here you're probabbly searching through the code, i know this website is extremely basic and being hold by scotch tape so please don't roast the shit out of me, instead dm me on how i could improve it, and consider this was developed by an italian small C/C++ developer  with little to no experience with css and html.

TO DO list:
1.  add a filter system for the clients (coming soon after the release)
2.  make the images work regardless of their position
3.  add a comment system for each client 
4.  make a little showcase for each client (coming soon after the release)
5.  create someway for a user to upload his own cracks with the rest of the community on the website
6.  create a review system for each client
7.  add more clients (coming very soon after the release, i wanted to release the websiter with the most requested clients for now, the rest are coming soon)
8.  collab with other archives and crackers
9.  create a custom plugin with backdoor without using openbukloit (unsure)
10. improve the code
11. create a custom client (probable, using liquidbounce nextgen as a base, don't expect anything crazy)
12. promoting free hack clients (idea from Wonderland archive)
