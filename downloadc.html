                <h2>Versions</h2>
                <p>Some clients prefer making their own minecraft version, without using forge or fabric. This is used in clients like Slak. You can install these client by typing %appdata% in the windows search bar, then go into .minecraft, then versions, then drag the folder of the client (that is found inside the .rar file) inside the versions folder, then open your launcher and add a new installation and find your client.</p>
