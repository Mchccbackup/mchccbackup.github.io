                <h2>ReGiulio's explaination</h2>
                <p>This is a simpler explaination</p>
                <p>Doubts were rased by 15ggd on our github about the safety of the Vape Lite, he reported his findings with a tria.ge rating. While I understand his concearns, I already did exactly what he did, putting it on tria.ge, and did some research on the founding of it, and the crack doesn't execute any malicious actions, it is suspicious but it is necessary in order for the vape to work. Not to forget that kangaroo team have been around for years (even before the start of MCHCC) and they have never released malware.</p>

                <h2>Whatify's explaination</h2>
                <p>Whatify is a staff member of luvsy's crib (check it out <a href="https://discord.gg/luvsy">here</a>), and since luvsy's crib had the exact same vape i asked him, to maybe have a deeper explaination, as they have a lot more experience than me for sure (btw shoutout to luvsy my italian fellow). Here is his explaination: things like writememory need admin (which is uac) for the client to work, tbh the vape crack has been analysed thoroughly and people have even reversed the kangaroo patcher which you can find on github and i can assure you it's all normal things, the kangaroos have a high repuation and don't ever release malware with their cracks, tbh these people think they're malware analysts but they don't even know what those native functions, like writememory, are doing, and, while they can be used for malware, you have to remember that cheats also use this kind of stuff. What i would say is suspicious for example is it trying to open the discord process (to grab tokens most likely) although there are really rare scenarios where cheats read the process memory of discord and extract your user id from there for authentication.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>I'm sure that the Vape Lite is safe, as explained both by me and Whatify. I'll keep it in the dangerous section in case some people are skeptical, and because it is a bit of a work around to make it work.</p>
