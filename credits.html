            <p>I'd like to thank "Catch" and "Chinaboy" for supporting me in this project and giving me advice. I'd like to thank "Laura lol" for ghosting me while i was talking to her, that really freed my time. "Dante patata" I'm sorry i rosted your ass so much twice in 2 days that you boyfriend "Daniele" had to come in and make peace, you should have not called me gay, you had no clue what i was capable of and what i used to say with "Toghe", i'm only sorry for bringing your brother in the beef, the whole motherfucking group sided with me, both times, how could you say you won lol, i'm not your friend don't act like i am. "Daniele" thanks for not inviting me anymore to ping pong, that freed my time a lot, i would still beat your ass at it like i did a year ago. "Toghe" for not even remembering MCHCC existed (my man, you are the only one that has friend role in the discord). Not's family for allowing me to access his account after his death, thanks and Not will be remebered by me and everyone who knew him. "Longo" and "micky229" you two are the gayest motherfuckers i know, idk how i could stand you guys back in middle school, informats tell me that now you are even gayer than years ago. </p>
